                History of Coffee in Indonesia üå∏
            </h2>
			<p> Coffee was not a native plant to the archipelago. In the 17th century, when Indonesia was still under Dutch occupation, the VOC brought Arabica coffee plants to Indonesia. They were interested in growing the plants and sought to break the worldwide Arab monopoly on the coffee trade. </p>
			<p> The Dutch Colonial Government initially planted coffee around Batavia (Jakarta), and as far south as Sukabumi and Bogor. Coffee plantations were later established in East Java, Central Java, West Java, and in parts of Sumatra and Sulawesi. Large areas of forested land were cleared and cultivated specifically for the development of these plantations. The growth of coffee plantations was responsible for the development of a lot of infrastructure in Central Java during the turn of the 19th century. Roads and railways were needed to transport the coffee beans from the island interior to the ports where the coffee was loaded on ships and exported. </p>
			<p> Prior to World War Two, Central Java, in particular, had a very strong rail transportation system that brought coffee, sugar, pepper, tea and tobacco out of the province to the port city of Semarang. East Indonesia, East Timor, and Flores were also producing coffee during this period. These islands, however, were still under Portuguese rule. The Portuguese had also imported Arabica coffee plants, but they were from a different root stock that what the Dutch had imported. </p>
			<h2>
      Slavery fueled Coffee production 
  </h2>
			<p> Saint-Domingue produced roughly 40 percent of the sugar and 60 percent of the coffee imported to Europe. The colonial economy was based almost entirely on the production of plantation crops for export. Enslaved African workers grew sugar in the northern plains around Cap Fran√ßais, for example, and coffee in the mountainous interior. The slave system in Saint-Domingue was regarded as one of the harshest in the Americas, with high levels of both mortality and violence. To supply the plantation system, French owners imported almost 800,000 Africans to the colony (which, by comparison, is almost double the number of Africans carried to North America). </p>
			<p> Some stories have a happy ending, where justice prevails. This is not one of those. Justice did happen- momentarily- then, the rest is history‚Ä¶ "Damn sugar, damn coffee, damn colonies!" a vanity shattered Napoleon wailed in anguish. It was January 1803 and he had lost more than 24,000 troops to the Haitian revolution. How tragic it must be for a coloniser to see a colony free. Losing Haiti rendered the newly acquired colony of Louisiana futile; it was purchased by the USA for $15 million. Why was Napoleon whining about a crop you drink as your morning beverage? The horrors of slavery in sugar plantations are well documented but not as many works analyse slavery on coffee plantations. Often, this is because colonies that used slave labour had flourishing sugar plantations but Saint-Domingue had a booming coffee-trade as well, unmatched by any colony at the time. </p>
			<h2>The Haitian Revolution ‚öîÔ∏è</h2>
			<p> According to 'Coffee: A Comprehensive Guide to the Bean, the Beverage, and the Industry', in 1767, the revenue generated from coffee was only a quarter to that of sugar yet by the years 1787-89, coffee equalised sugar revenues, making Saint-Domingue the world's largest export market for coffee. The book also mentions how this caffeinated contribution allowed "French colonies as a whole" to generate "over two-thirds of the world coffee supply." Yet, "The height of coffee production in Haiti was also its demise" as historian Augustine Sedgewick writes in 'Coffeeland: A History', adding that "A creation of empire and slavery, coffee became a casualty of the Haitian Revolution." A casualty but also an eyewitness. The Haitian Revolution, which began in 1791 was the only successful slave rebellion in history. Before gaining independence, Haiti was the French colony known as Saint-Domingue. Low costs of production achieved by importing African slave labour, helped make Saint-Domingue one of the wealthiest- if not the wealthiest-colony in the world. Being the world's leading producer of coffee and sugar, it produced "40 percent of the sugar and 60 percent of the coffee imported to Europe." These plantations were the cash-cow of colonial France. If plantations could speak, they would re-count with trembling voices, the sound of the whips, the cries, the scars which turned to ashes but left a permanent mark. Slavery may have been abolished but its past could not. </p>

    Coffee Plantations üî•
  </h2>
			<p> To protect its monopoly on the more valuable 'Mocha' bean, the French East India Company did not allow "coffee grown in either Bourbon or the Caribbean to be sold in France" until the 1730s, writes Jonathan Morris in 'Coffee: A Global History.' Increasing demand for coffee in France came at the expense of freedom for African slaves. Shackled and dragged over the shore, they were forced to work in dire conditions and degraded all the same. Almost double the amount of African slaves were imported into Saint-Domingue than those taken to North America. It was no secret that Saint-Domingue's economy literally relied on slaves. In 1771, a colonist wrote: "There can be no agriculture in Saint Domingue without slavery; we did not go to fetch half a million savage slaves off the coast of Africa to bring them to the colony as French citizens." For the colonists and most plantation owners- slaves were not people. </p>
			<p> Saint-Domingue was based on a four-tier caste system. At the top where the white, wealthy plantation owners, known as 'the grand blancs'. These were followed by 'the petits blancs', the lower-class white population. Then came the 'gens de couleur', who were of mixed ancestry as some were offspring produced by white French settlers and black slaves, and the remaining being freed ex-slaves. This group, though racially discriminated against, was still wealthy and some members even owned plantations themselves. At the bottom of the racial hierarchy were the African slaves, who were imported in the masses as the labour force for the sugar and coffee plantations. </p>
			<p> Even as over a thousand coffee plantations were destroyed after Haiti gained independence, including P.J. Labourie's- also stated by Morris- nothing can erase the painful past of a wicked man-made institution; one coffee plantations played host to. </p>
			<h2>
    THE COFFEE TRADE LOST ‚öúÔ∏è
  </h2>
			<p> Paradoxically, while coffee is viewed as a liberating beverage in US history- a symbol of American patriotism in defiance of British colonialism after the Boston Tea party- America was complicit in colonialism and contributed to slavery through the coffee trade. Sedgewick mentions in his book: "As historian Steven Topik has pointed out, to highlight the roles of revolution, independence, and freedom in the history of U.S. coffee drinking is to overlook the much greater importance of slavery." </p>
			<p> After gaining independence, Haiti lost its coffee trade for two reasons. Firstly, as Sedgewick points out "in deference to Napoleon, the U.S. cut commercial ties" with Haiti. Secondly, the USA and European states "shunned Haiti for fear of legitimizing black rule" writes Morris in his book. Thomas Jefferson- who so loved the fight for independence- did not feel the same revolutionary spirit when it resulted in black victory. Hearing about Haiti, he was afraid of similar revolutions taking place elsewhere and in 1797, wrote: </p>
			<h2>
    End of Slavery = More Slavery üí¢
  </h2>
			<p> The Haitian revolution may have abolished slavery in Haiti but it ironically led to increased slavery in Brazil. Cutting of commercial ties with Haiti, eyes turned to Brazil as the coffee growing empire. Once again, increased coffee production meant increased slavery. Many of these slaves were supplied by American slave traders, who could no longer trade slaves in the US, which abolished slavery in 1865. Brazil has its own tragic story of slavery on the coffee plantations. As the world became more and more obsessed with coffee, it turned a blind eye to how it was produced. </p>
			<p> In 1888, Brazil became the last American nation to abolish slavery. The Saint-Domingue story is a reminder that social justice may remain an abstract ideal unless we recognise our privilege as the people who consume and fight for those who produce. Lest we become complicit in crimes that echo voices of the plantations from Saint-Domingue. </p>
			<h2>
    The history of Brazilian coffee üéë
  </h2>
			<p> Legend has it that in 1727, Sergeant Major Francisco de Melo Palheta was dispatched to settle a land dispute between French Guiana and Dutch Guiana. He arrived in Cayenne intent on smuggling out the coveted coffee plants that were so closely guarded. Setting his eyes on Madame D‚ÄôOrvilliers, the Governor of Cayenne‚Äôs wife, he hatched a plan, and at the a closing banquet before his departure, his amorous exploits paid off, as she handed him a bouquet containing the seedling that would become the progenitor of the Brazilian coffee industry. Though amorous motivation for for the exchange has been discputed, Palheta was, as a matter of record, sent to French Guiana by the governor of Maranh√£o e Gr√£o-Par√° in northeastern Brasil, and later described how he was able to bring back thousands of seeds and several plants. Throughout the 18th century, coffee production increased in northeastern Brasil, although it was never considered more than a minor local crop. </p>
			<p> The first coffee plantation was established by 1770 in the state of Rio de Janeiro and a small export trade to Europe soon developed. However, it was not until the 1800s that coffee production exploded in Brazil. The year 1800 saw, 1,720 pounds of coffee exports, and by 1820 that number had reached 12,896,000 pounds. By 1840, that number had grown to 137,300,000, and by at the end of the century Brazil was exporting over a billion pounds of coffee annually (Ukers, 1922). From the Baixada Fluminese region in the state of Rio de Janeiro, coffee production began expanding into the Vale do Para√≠ba, moving south and west into Minas Gerais and into the then province of S√£o Paulo. By the late 1800s, S√£o Paulo was the coffee center of the Brazil as production moved from the now-depleted soils of the Vale do Para√≠ba westward to more fertile soils, a better climate, and flatter topography around Campinas, Rio Claro, and Jundiai. Production increases were largely fueled by slave labor, with estimates that over 5 million African slaves‚Äîmore than half of those imported to the New World‚Äîwere brought to Brazil (Adams, 1925). While the institution of African slavery had existed in Brazil since the 16th century, it grew considerably in the 17th century with the expansion of sugarcane production and gold and diamond mining. Abolition appeared imminent in 1826 with signing of the British-Brazilian Treaty, which set to end slavery by 1830, but it would take over 50 years for the practice to die, as so many directly profited from the slave trade and the government lacked enforcement capabilities. In total, between 1800 and 1850, the Brazilian agriculture and coffee boom absorbed well over 2 million African slaves. </p>
			<h2>
    Immigration and Coffee Migration 
  </h2>
			<p> As coffee moved westward in S√£o Paulo, growers faced a ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù of labor headwinds: increased labor demanded by higher productivity, a lack of slave labor, driving a more expensive slave market, and growing resentment of the institution of slavery. Although Brazil would not officially abolish slavery until 1888, it was already in decline thanks to measures such as the Aberdeen Act, passed in the United Kingdom of 1845, which gave the Royal Navy authority to stop and search any Brazilian vessel suspected of transporting slaves and to arrest slave traders. This directly led to higher costs and a diminishing supply of slave labor. The Law of Free Birth (also known as the Rio Branco Law) of 1871 granted freedom to all newborn children of slaves and slaves belonging to the state and royal family. Owners of the children‚Äôs slave parents were to provide care for the children until the age of 21, when they would turn them over to the state for monetary compensation. </p>
			<p> Slavery was finally abolished in Brazil with the passage of the Lei Aurea, or Golden Law, on May 13, 1888. This quickly led to a political policy of immigration to supply labor on the ever-growing coffee plantations. Brazil had first experimented with importing foreign labor to work the coffee fields 20 years earlier at Fazenda Ibicada in the state of S√£o Paulo. Between 1847 and 1857, plantation owner and senator Nicolau Vergueiro brought in around 180 families, mainly Swiss-Germans, to work on his farm. But his experiment ended in rebellion and failure. After all, plantation managers were accustomed to dealing with slaves, not citizens with rights and the expectations that go along with them. What‚Äôs more, the contractual obligations that Vergueiro imposed on the immigrants were far from just. He charged them for their transportation to and settlement in Brazil, and then imposed substantial interests on those costs, resulting in de facto indentured servitude. This situation was far different from what they had been promised, and under the leadership of Swiss schoolteacher Thomas Davatz, who had immigrated to Ibicada and was appalled by the situation he observed, the immigrant families revolted. Switzerland was forced to halt emigration to Brazil, and the Empire of Brazil subsequently reconsidered legislation regarding work conditions and the regulation of importation of foreign labor. </p>
			<h2>
    Overproduction üë©üèø‚Äçüåæ
  </h2>
			<p> In time, coffee production increased to the point where it outgrew demand, and prices began to fall. Brazil's New Republic government (after a peaceful coup d'etat of Dom Pedro II's monarch) initially responded by printing more money, but this resulted in high inflation and a greatly devalued currency. While this pleased the powerful coffee growers, who received their money in foreign currency, it wreaked havoc on internal markets and made it difficult for Brazil to service its foreign debt. Coffee prices, which had fluctuated between 14 and 18 cents per pound on the New York market between 1888 and 1895, sunk to ten cents after a bumper crop in 1896, and by 1901 the price of a pound of coffee had fallen to six cents. After a failed international attempt to shore up prices at the first International Congress for the Study of the Production and Consumption of Coffee, Brazil decided to go it alone. In 1906, representatives from S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais‚ÄîBrazil's three largest coffee-growing states‚Äîsigned the treaty of Taubate which set for a valorization scheme in which the government would agree to buy surplus coffee and keep it off the market to ensure higher prices. The valorization scheme successfully inhibited a free-fall of coffee pricing, though it did little to discourage coffee production, since growers now had the advantage of a price floor. The scheme was repeated after the first World War, but as Brazil‚Äôs near-monopoly on worldwide coffee production declined, it became necessary to internationalize the valorization scheme across other producing countries. This was accomplished through the Inter-American Coffee Agreement and later the International Coffee Agreement. The International Coffee Agreement, administered by the International Coffee Organization, lasted until 1989, when the United States withdrew its support. Shortly after this, coffee prices dropped substantially. </p>
