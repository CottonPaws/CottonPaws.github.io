			<h1>  üåø The Origin of Coffee: Kaldi and the Dancing Goats ‚òï</h1> <img src="img/kaldi.jpg">
			<p> The ancient land of Ethiopia may be the cradle of all humankind. But more importantly it is the birthplace of coffee. Here in the mountainous rainforests near Kaffa , coffee has grown wild for milennia. In any event, according to popular legend, the origin of coffee can be traced to the day, maybe a thousand years ago, when an Abyssinian (Ethiopian) goatherd named Kaldi observed his goats prancing and frolicking about. Kaldi had previously found the behavior of his goats to be ‚Äúirreproachable,‚Äù so he knew that something unusual was going on.When Kaldi investigated, he saw that the goats were merrily eating the red berries and shiny leaves of an unfamiliar tree. Kaldi decided to try some, and when he did he joined the dancing goats and became ‚Äúthe happiest herder in happy Arabia.‚Äù </p>
			<p> Some time later, a passing monk observed Kaldi and the goats. When Kaldi told him about the berries, the monk thought they might be the answer to his prayers. It seems that the monk was always falling asleep in the middle of prayers. When he ate the berries, he stayed awake.The unnamed monk came up with the idea of drying and boiling the berries to make a beverage. His fellow monks loved the new drink because it encouraged them to pray‚Äîand it tasted good too. So now that I know about Kaldi and his goats, if someday‚Äîin the far, far future, someone calls me an ‚Äúold goat,‚Äù I‚Äôll just smile, have another sip of coffee, and maybe do a little dance.</p>
			<p>
				<h2>Ethiopian Coffee History üå±</h2>
				<p> That legend did not appear in writing until 1671 and most accounts date Kaldi to 850, so it's hard to say how much is truth and myth. Kaldi's story does coincide with the commonly held belief that coffee cultivation began in Ethiopia during the 9th century (the Yemenite origin points to an earlier date).Additionally, Kaffa's goat legend suggests that both the stimulant and beverage possibilities of coffee were discovered in a single day. However, historians think that coffee had been chewed as a stimulant for centuries prior to this. It's thought that the ground beans were mixed into a thick paste with ghee (clarified butter) or animal fat, then rolled into small balls. This would have been a useful source of energy on long, arduous journeys. </p> <img src="img/map.jpg">
				<p> It's further believed by some historians that the custom of chewing coffee beans was brought (along with coffee itself) from Kaffa to Harrar and Arabia by enslaved Oromo tribesman. Supposedly, the enslaved Sudanese picked up the custom from the Galla tribe of Ethiopia. In some areas of Kaffa and Sidamo, the tradition of consuming ground coffee in ghee remains. Some people in Kaffa also add melted ghee to brewed coffee for extra flavor and to make it more nutritionally dense. </p>
				<h2>Yemen's Coffee Origin Myths üåÑ</h2> <img src="img/origin.jpg">
				<p> Yemen also has a coffee origin myth (or two) as well as a well-founded stake in the beverage's actual history. The first legend from Yemen is rather basic by comparison to the Kaldi myth. However, in an interesting twist, it attributes the origin of coffee to Ethiopia. The Yemenite Sufi mystic Ghothul Akbar Nooruddin Abu al-Hasan al-Shadhili was traveling through Ethiopia, presumably on spiritual matters. He encountered some very energetic birds that had been eating the fruit of the bunn plant (known elsewhere as the coffee plant). Weary from his journey, he decided to try these berries for himself and he found that they produced an energetic state in him as well. </p>
				<p> The second coffee origin myth from Yemen claims that coffee originated in Yemen. The story is centered around Sheikh Omar, a doctor-priest and a follower of Sheik Abou'l Hasan Schadheli from Mocha, Yemen, who was exiled to a desert cave close to the mountain of Ousab. According to one version, this exile was for some sort of moral transgression. According to another version, Omar was exiled because he practiced medicine on the princess instead of on his master‚Äîwho was on his deathbed. After curing her, he decided to "keep" her (interpret that as you wish) and he was exiled by the king as punishment. After some time of exile and on the verge of starvation, Omar found the red berries of the coffee plant and tried to eat them. One version of the story says that a bird brought him a branch bearing coffee cherries after he cried out in despair for guidance from his master, Schadheli. </p>
				<p> However, he found them to be too bitter to eat raw. Hoping to remove their bitterness, he threw the berries into the fire. This basic "roasting" technique hardened the berries, making them unsuitable for chewing. Omar then attempted to soften them. As the roasted berries boiled, he noticed the pleasant aroma of the increasingly brown liquid and decided to drink this decoction rather than eat the beans. He found the drink to be revitalizing and shared his tale with others. In another version of the story, Omar found the raw beans to be delicious and decided to make them into a soup. When the roasted coffee cherries were removed, the "soup" became something closely resembling the drink we know of as coffee. </p>
				<p> The story of Omar's invigorating drink quickly reached his hometown of Mocha. His exile was lifted and he was ordered to return home with the berries he had discovered. Returning to Mocha, he shared coffee beans and the drink of coffee with others, who found that it "cured" many ailments. It was not long before they hailed coffee as a miracle drug and Omar as a saint. A monastery was built in Mocha in Omar's honor. </p>
				<h2>Yemen's Coffee History üåæ</h2>
				<p> Although there are many accounts of coffee history dating back to the ninth century and earlier, the earliest credible evidence of humans interacting with the coffee plant comes from the middle of the 15th century. This is when it was consumed in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen. Monks drank it to stay alert during their nighttime devotions and long hours of prayer. However, it is generally believed that coffee beans were originally exported from Ethiopia to Yemen. Later, Yemeni traders brought coffee plants back to their homes and began to cultivate them there. </p>
				<p> Yemen is also the origin of the term "mocha." While today it is most often associated with chocolate-flavored coffee drinks, such as the mocha latte, it originally referred to the city of Mocha on Yemen's Red Sea coast. It was a major trade center for the Mocha style of coffee bean‚Äîa type of coffee prized for its distinctive flavor It was in Yemen that drinking coffee, made from roasted beans , is first documented. The most popular species of coffee was born here , Coffea Arabica , which now makes up 60% of the world coffee supply In Yemen , they named the drink Qawha, which is the arabic word for wine , from which the word coffee probably comes from. By the end of the 15th century , coffee had spread throughout the islamic world and the caf√© was born. </p>
				<h2>The Turkish Caf√© History üïå</h2> <img src="img/turk-cafe.jpg">
				<p> The Turkish coffee history starts with the introduction of the coffee beans to Turkey. There are two different stories about how coffee entered the Turkish culture. Each version seems historically correct. So, every coffee story teller can pick either of them or why not both of them. </p>
				<p> Version A : In 1517 the Ottoman Governor of Yemen √ñzdemir Pa≈üa (~Ozdemir Pasha~) found out about a new beverage in his region. It was a drink from coffee beans. He decided to introduce it to the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. The new drink impressed the Sultan so much that he gave the Royal seal of approval.
					<p> Version B : In 1554 two Syrian men named Hakam from Aleppo & Shams from Damascus moved to Istanbul bringing coffee beans to Turkey. They opened separate coffee shops in the commercial district of Tahtekale following the idea of Yemen‚Äôs shops. </p>
					<h2>The first Turkish coffee brew ‚òï</h2> <img src="img/turk-brew.jpg">
					<p> After the introduction of coffee beans to Turkey the Sultan‚Äôs palace took over. His cuisine staff decided to try a new method in preparing the ‚Äúblack drink‚Äù. They first grounded roasted coffee beans in mortars. Afterwards they boiled the coffee powder with water in a special coffee pot. This pot is known until today as ‚Äúcezve‚Äù (~jezve~). A new coffee brew appeared in the Palace scene. It became very popular in the palace premises from the first time. The elite mansions found about this new drink very soon. Later, the general public all over the Ottoman Empire got to know it in a matter of time. </p>
					<p> Turkish coffee making soon became a profession. A lot of people were opening coffee houses. They were serving this new drink along with other refreshments. The palace and other high rack governing authorities were employing specialty coffee makers called ‚Äúkahveci usta‚Äù. They were responsible to prepare coffee to guests like in a ceremonial event. During this period, as Turkish coffee history states, coffee was a very valuable commodity among people. </p>

      Turkish coffee history üìî
    </h2>
					<p>Turkish coffee history provides a lot of information on the creation and the role of coffee houses. In 1554 the first coffee houses (‚ÄúKaveh kanes‚Äù) appeared in Istanbul. They were the first meeting places to drink coffee. People who were gathering there were discussing local news or politics. They could also play chess or backgammon. Turkish coffee history mentions coffee houses many times as very popular places for business meetings.</p>
					<p>In 1656 the Ottoman Grand Bizier K√∂pr√ºl√º issued laws for shutting the coffee houses. He decided to make coffee drinking illegal. According to Turkish coffee history this act was a tremendous shock to the people. Punishments for disobedience included beating and drowning! Turkish authorities observed coffee as a threat to the Empire. According to Turkish coffee history people were gathering in coffee houses and were discussing politics. Some of them were talking about ways to downfall the Sultan as well. These laws did not succeed. People reacted very negatively with riots. The authorities abolished these laws after the violent reaction of people. During those times the Sultan put a heavy taxation on the coffee houses as an extra income to the State. </p>

          Turkish coffee to Europe üåç
        </h2> <img src="img/turk-cafe2.jpg">
					<p> Coffee was first introduced to Europe in Hungary when the Turks invaded Hungary at the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526. Within a year, coffee had reached Vienna by the same Turks who fought the Europeans at the Siege of Vienna (1529). Later in the 16th century, coffee was introduced on the island of Malta through slavery. Turkish Muslim slaves had been imprisoned by the Knights of St John in 1565‚Äîthe year of the Great Siege of Malta, and they used them to make their traditional beverage. Domenico Magri mentioned in his work Virtu del Kaf√©, "Turks, most skilful makers of this concoction." Also the German traveller Gustav Sommerfeldt in 1663 wrote "the ability and industriousness with which the Turkish prisoners earn some money, especially by preparing coffee, a powder resembling snuff tobacco, with water and sugar." Coffee was a popular beverage in Maltese high society‚Äîmany coffee shops opened The Venetians later were recorded as the first traders responsible for coffee expansion to Europe by merchandising coffee beans as a serious commodity. Coffee expansion influenced the vocabulary of all the nations that were introduced to this new product. ‚ÄúCoffee‚Äù as an English word was used in the English language around 1600 AD from the Italian ‚Äòcaffe‚Äô. This word came from the Turkish word for coffee ‚Äòkahve‚Äô. The Turkish word was reproduced either from the Arabic word ‚Äògahwa‚Äô (prevent sleeping) or the Ethiopian word ‚ÄúKaffa‚Äù (Kingdom of Kaffa, the region of the first coffee plants). </p> In 1657 Sultan Mehmet IV visited France. Among other presents, he gave to King Louis XIV coffee beans. This gesture was the initial introduction of the French society to Turkish style coffee. Turkish coffee history mentions this event as the first step to expand coffee to the rich European countries. </div>
